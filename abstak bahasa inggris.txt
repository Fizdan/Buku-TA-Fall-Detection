inspection routine of railroad conditions has been carried out by PT Kereta Api Indonesia (PT KAI) using a measurement train. Due to the unbalanced number of trains with the length of the railway tracks to be checked, the rail inspection can only be run four times a year. It is still not enough to update the rail condition data. In this final project a real time railway monitoring system by using vibration sensor to identify rail condition based on location is developed. Data can be updated faster because the system can be applied to all types of trains. After testing, the average sensor error was obtained with a location error of 3.7 meters, a speed error of 7.65 \%, and an accelerometer error of 0.059 g and a data transmission time interval of 1.04 seconds. With the development of this tool, railway inspection personnel will get reports of railroad conditions based on the color of marker in accordance with the parameter of the index value and with the early warning application, train drivers receive maximum speed limit notification at certain rail locations.
